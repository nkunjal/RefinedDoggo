# RefinedDoggo

# Description #
This is the refined version of the Doggo app, to be prototyped in BestFriends animal shelters.
In order to ensure the best chance of getting a foster animal to be adopted, the photo posted on the internet should be eye level, and the animal should be happy.
Our app aims to do just this, by guiding a shelter owner into taking good photos of their animals.
This app uses the cloud vision api, to determine what is in the contents of a certain photo in the app. 
For future applications, we will use these labels to determine the quality of an animal's photo.
